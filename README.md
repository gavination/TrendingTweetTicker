A very silly could based application using the [Pipes and Filters pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/pipes-and-filters) built for fun that queries recent tweets about a provided subject (In my use case, it was Kim Kardashian's and Kany West's divorce), runs them through a sentiment analysis engine using Microsoft's Cognitive Services API, and sends a SMS message to a provided recipient with detailed information regarding the sentiment.
